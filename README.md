# Hitchhiker Neon Desert Atom Editor UI Theme

With this theme the hope is to recreate a dark theme that provides a dark gray
base background color along with pastels (or neon colors) for highlighting.

I find it a good UI theme for editing during periods of light-sensitivity from migraines.

The name is a homage of Douglas Adams' Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. When an
associate and I were experimenting with a different editor's dark theme
settings (many years ago) we decided that choosing the number 42 in
rgb(42, 42, 42) would suffice nicely. We proceeded to replicate this idea
throughout all of our systems' editable interfaces.

I hope to replicate such a theme here.
