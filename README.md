# Hitchhiker Neon Desert UI Theme

This package will provide a dark Atom UI theme with pastels for a not-so-stark, high contrast by utilizing dark gray base background color along with pastels (or neon colors) for highlighting and selections.

It is based one the One Dark UI Theme.

The name gives homage of Douglas Adams' Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy due to the use of universally significant number 42 in the base background color of rgb(42, 42, 42), or hitchhiker gray.
